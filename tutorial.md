###Is there a better way?

I've been programming in Java since I was an undergrad in college in 2006. While working a contract job in 2011-2012 in which I was hired to work with a huge mess of Java code[<sup>1</sup>](#1), I was left wondering if Java was rotting my brain. Surely, there has got to be a better way. After an impractical detour[<sup>2</sup>](#2), I decided to take on learning [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), a Lisp dialect for the JVM. After a two-year journey of hacking personal projects, Clojure is now my general programming language of choice.

While learning how to write apps for [Android](http://developer.android.com/), I was back to programming in Java and again was left thinking that there has got to be a better way! I looked into developing Android apps using Clojure. Although there
is still much room for maturation, the efforts of [Daniel Solano Gómez](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NptqU3bqZE), [Alex Yakushev](http://clojure-android.blogspot.com/2013/06/state-of-clojure-on-android-2013.html), and [Zach Oakes](https://nightweb.net/blog/clojure-on-android.html) show a promising future for Clojure in Android development.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial is directed towards Clojure programmers who are seeking an alternative to the Java language for Android development. I will assume that you already know the basics of Clojure[<sup>3</sup>](#3) and Android.

We will be using Alex Yakushev's [lein-droid](https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid) tool for project management. We will also be using Alex's fork of Daniel Solano Gómez's [neko library](https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/neko/wiki) which provides function wrappers and alternatives to the Android Java API. However, neko does not replace everything as of the time of this writing and is subject to change so keep the [Android docs](http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html) handy. There will be some Java interop in this tutorial. We will be using [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with the [nrepl] (https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl) plugin for this tutorial.

**Be forewarned:** some tools in this setup are still very young and are in fast development. New versions may pop up as of the time of this writing (November 5, 2014) and may introduce breaking changes. For your information, here are the versions of the tools that I am using:

```
Arch Linux
Java 1.7.0_95
org.clojure-android/clojure 1.7.0-r2
Leiningen 2.5.3
lein-droid 0.4.3
Android SDK Tools 24.4.1
Android SDK Platform-tools 23.1
Android SDK Build-tools 23.0.2
org.clojure/tools.nrepl 0.2.10
neko 4.0.0-alpha5
```

Now that you have been **forewarned**, let's begin. If you run into problems, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/krisc/events/issues), and I'll try my best to help you out.

### What are we making?

Let's make a simple event listing app. This will not be a full-fledged calendar app, but rather a simple tool to pencil in events and have them sorted in chronological order. I have a text file on my desktop that I use to pencil in dates for gigs, practices, and other events.

![text document of event listing](desktop.png)

Our app will be based off of this simple idea.

### Using lein-droid to setup our project

Alex's [Tutorial](https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid/wiki/Tutorial) is a good introduction to `lein-droid`. Skim through the tutorial to familiarize yourself with the basic `lein-droid` commands.

This is how my `~/.lein/profiles.clj` looks like:
```clojure
{:user {:plugins [ [lein-droid "0.4.3"] ] }}
```

Run this command at the terminal:

```bash
lein new droid events org.stuff.events :activity MainActivity :target-sdk 15 :app-name EventsListing
```

This will create a template file structure for an Android app. Open the `project.clj` file and make sure the `neko` version in `:dependencies` is `"4.0.0-alpha5"`. Also put the following into `:android` map (change the directory to reflect your own sdk's path):

```clojure
:sdk-path "/home/kris/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20130522/sdk/"
```

You can also put this option into `profiles.clj` as described [here](https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid/wiki/Profiles#android-common). Note that you shouldn't use `:user` profile for this as it is ignored by default in lein-droid projects.

If you have an actual Android device at hand, connect it to your computer. If not, you can setup an [emulator](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html). Now run `lein droid doall` at the terminal. This will build the app, install the app to your device, and open an `nREPL` server within the running app.

### Define the Layout

Let's open the main Clojure source file located at `./src/clojure/org/stuff/events/main.clj` in `emacs` and start defining the layout and the application.

If you don't already have Cider installed, you can install it by running this in `emacs`: `M-x package-install cider`. Now run this in `emacs`: `M-x cider-connect` and enter the local machine (e.g. localhost) for 'Host' and '9999' for 'Port'. Now you have a REPL in `emacs` which is connected to your running app. As you will see in a bit, this is neat-o torpedo.

To enter the namespace, type this command into the REPL: `(in-ns 'org.stuff.events.main)` To start evaluating definitions within our app's namespace, evaluate the `ns` form in the source file by entering the `emacs` command `C-c C-n` (or by moving the cursor after the closing parenthesis of the `ns` form and hitting `C-x C-e`).

Let's now code a definition for the layout of the app. The `set-content-view!` function takes in a vector of elements which will be transformed into XML ([learn more here](https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/neko/wiki/User-interface)). This structure can be anonymously passed into `set-content-view!`, but let's give it a named definition:

```clojure
(def main-layout [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event name"}]
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event location"}]])
```

Evaluate this `def` form. Let's change the `defactivity` form to look like this:

```clojure
(defactivity org.stuff.events.MainActivity
  :key :main

  (onCreate [this bundle]
    (.superOnCreate this bundle)
    (on-ui
     (set-content-view! (*a) main-layout))
    ))
```

You might wonder what `(*a)` is. It is a development convenience macro that returns Activity instance when called inside the namespace with `defactivity`. But please keep in mind that it is strongly suggested to use `(*a)` only during the development. For the release version replace calls to `(*a)` with proper passing the Activity instance as an argument (here `this` is bound to Activity instance, and you can pass it to other functions).

### Interactive Development

To demonstrate the power of REPL driven development, move your cursor after the closing parenthesis of the `on-ui` form (after the third-to-last `)` from the end), then hit `C-x C-e`.

![screen 1](screen1.png)

And just like that, the layout has changed. After you have finished geeking out on how cool what just happened was, let's add a button to the layout. Our `def` form for `main-layout` should now look like this:

```clojure
(def main-layout [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event name"}]
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event location"}]
                  [:button {:text "+ Event"}]])
```

Evaluate this form. Then evaluate the `on-ui` form to update the app. (From now on, you can assume that newly added code should be evaluated.)

![screen 2](screen2.png)

### Adding Functionality

The app doesn't really do anything right now. Let's add attributes to our layout elements for functionality.

```clojure
(def main-layout [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                               :id ::name}]
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                               :id ::location}]
                  [:button {:text "+ Event"}]])
```

Re-evaluate the `(on-ui ...)` form.

In order to access the layout by name, we added a `:id` attributes with a keyword value to our `edit-text` elements. We should also import some additional functions:

```clojure
(ns org.stuff.events.main
  (:require [neko.activity :refer [defactivity set-content-view!]]
            [neko.debug :refer [*a]]
            [neko.find-view :refer [find-view]]
            [neko.threading :refer [on-ui]])
  (:import android.widget.TextView))
```

With these additions, we can now access the values of these elements using `find-view`. Enter some text into the edit-text fields in the running app:

![screen 3](screen3.png)

Then try these at the REPL:

```clojure
org.stuff.events.main> (find-view (*a) ::name)
#<EditText android.widget.EditText{659eb5d0 VFED..CL ........ 0,0-360,122 #1ce18747}>
org.stuff.events.main> (str (.getText (find-view (*a) ::name)))
"Party"
org.stuff.events.main> (str (.getText (find-view (*a) ::location)))
"Your Place"
```

Note that the return value for the widget objects will probably be different for you. Now let's write a helper function for our convenience:

```clojure
(defn get-elmt [activity elmt]
  (str (.getText ^TextView (find-view activity elmt))))
```

Note how we type-hinted the argument to `.getText` to avoid reflection. Since `EditText` inherits `TextView`, we can use the latter hint to retrieve text from edit fields.

Now let's have that button do some work.

```clojure
(declare add-event)

(def main-layout [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                               :id ::name}]
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                               :id ::location}]
                  [:button {:text "+ Event",
                            :on-click (fn [^android.widget.Button b]
                                        (add-event (.getContext b)))}]])
```

We added an `:on-click` attribute to our `:button` element whose value is a callback function. Note the forward declaration for that callback function.

Well, we know that we need to add an event to the listing. First, let's add a new element to the layout that will contain the listing. We will also create an atom[<sup>4</sup>](#4) to hold the current state of the listing.

```clojure
(def listing (atom ""))

(def main-layout [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                               :id ::name}]
                  [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                               :id ::location}]
                  [:button {:text "+ Event"
                            :on-click (fn [^android.widget.Button b]
                                        (add-event (.getContext b)))}]
                  [:text-view {:text @listing,
                               :id ::listing}]])
```

The value of the listing atom is used for the :text attribute of the newly added :text-view element.

Note how we used the Button object provided as an argument to callback to extract Activity (Context) instance and pass it to `add-event`. While you can use tricks like these, you'll soon reach the point when an explicit Activity object is required in defining the layout. Besides, it's a good idea to keep the number of `def` (eager evaluation) lower. So, let's replace the `def` with `defn`:

```clojure
(defn main-layout [activity]
  [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                :id ::name}]
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                :id ::location}]
   [:button {:text "+ Event"
             :on-click (fn [_] (add-event activity))}]
   [:text-view {:text @listing,
                :id ::listing}]])
```

Also remember to update the following line in the defactivity:

```clojure
(set-content-view! (*a) (main-layout (*a)))
```

See how we still use `(*a)`. We could use it just the same in `main-layout`! —
you might say. But it would be impossible to replace it with proper Activity
argument later, if we didn't turn main-layout into a function.

Before we define the callback function, let's play with the REPL and figure out what we actually want to do when the user hits that button. First, we want to update the listing atom with the contents of the `:edit-text` fields. Enter an event in the running app then run this in the REPL:

```clojure
org.stuff.events.main> (swap! listing str (get-elmt (*a) ::location) " - " 
		       (get-elmt (*a) ::name) "\n")
"Your Place - Party\n"
```

Next, we want to update the ui with the listing. We can use the `config` macro in `neko.ui` to achieve this. Let's update the `ns` form at the top of the source:

```clojure
...
[neko.ui :refer [config]]
...
```

Run `C-c C-n` to evaluate the `ns` form then evaluate that `on-ui` form in the `defactivity`. Next, enter this into the REPL:


```clojure
org.stuff.events.main> (on-ui (config (find-view (*a) ::listing) :text @listing))
```

Let's write another helper function for setting the text of our elements.

```clojure
(defn set-elmt [activity elmt s]
  (on-ui (config (find-view activity elmt) :text s)))
```

Let's have our callback function perform these two tasks:

```clojure
(defn add-event [activity]
  (swap! listing str (get-elmt activity ::location) " - " 
         (get-elmt activity ::name) "\n")
  (set-elmt activity ::listing @listing))
```

Now try hitting that button. Cool, huh?

![screen 5](screen5.png)

If you need to clear your listing, just run `(def listing (atom ""))`.

Hitting the button should also clear the edit fields. Let's write a function to take care of all that.

```clojure
(defn update-ui [activity]
  (set-elmt activity ::listing @listing)
  (set-elmt activity ::location "")
  (set-elmt activity ::name ""))

```

And let's have our `add-event` function call this.

```clojure
(defn add-event [activity]
  (swap! listing str (get-elmt activity ::location) " - " 
         (get-elmt activity ::name) "\n")
  (update-ui activity))
```

If you're coding along at home (and I hope you are!), here is what our code should look like so far:

```clojure
(ns org.stuff.events.main
  (:require [neko.activity :refer [defactivity set-content-view!]]
            [neko.debug :refer [*a]]
            [neko.ui :refer [config]]
            [neko.find-view :refer [find-view]]
            [neko.threading :refer [on-ui]])
  (:import android.widget.TextView))

(declare add-event)

(def listing (atom ""))

(defn main-layout [activity]
  [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                :id ::name}]
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                :id ::location}]
   [:button {:text "+ Event"
             :on-click (fn [_] (add-event activity))}]
   [:text-view {:text @listing,
                :id ::listing}]])

(defn get-elmt [activity elmt]
  (str (.getText ^TextView (find-view activity elmt))))

(defn set-elmt [activity elmt s]
  (on-ui (config (find-view activity elmt) :text s)))

(defn update-ui [activity]
  (set-elmt activity ::listing @listing)
  (set-elmt activity ::location "")
  (set-elmt activity ::name ""))

(defn add-event [activity]
  (swap! listing str (get-elmt activity ::location) " - " 
         (get-elmt activity ::name) "\n")
  (update-ui activity))

(defactivity org.stuff.events.MainActivity
  :key :main

  (onCreate [this bundle]
    (.superOnCreate this bundle)
    (on-ui
      (set-content-view! (*a) (main-layout (*a))))
    ))
```

So far so good... But if you now rotate your screen, everything will disappear. To prevent this reload (`C-x C-e`) the whole `defactivity` form. This will preserve the UI across orientation changes.

What now? It might be a good idea to build your app right now by running at the terminal `lein droid doall`, though it is not mandatory, you can just continue as is. Note that you may have to connect your REPL again after you run this command.

### Just One Little Fix

![screen 6](screen6.png)

If you rotated your screen, you may have noticed that the listing disappears. Let's fix that, shall we?

```clojure
(defactivity org.stuff.events.MainActivity
  :key :main

  (onCreate [this bundle]
    (.superOnCreate this bundle)
    (on-ui
      (set-content-view! (*a) (main-layout (*a))
      (set-elmt (*a) ::listing @listing)))
    ))
```

Rotate your screen.

![screen 4](screen4.png)

Now that's what I'm talking about. The REPL never ceases to amaze me.

### The Date Picker
What's the point of an event listing without sorted dates? Let's use java interop to make a date picker[<sup>5</sup>](#5).

![pic of datepicker](screen7.png)

First, let's add some imports into our `ns` form:

```clojure
(ns org.stuff.events.main
  (:require [neko.activity :refer [defactivity set-content-view!]]
            [neko.debug :refer [*a]]
            [neko.ui :refer [on-ui]]
            [neko.find-view :refer [find-view]]
            [neko.threading :refer [on-ui]])
  (:import android.widget.TextView
           (java.util Calendar)
           (android.app Activity)
           (android.app DatePickerDialog DatePickerDialog$OnDateSetListener)
           (android.app DialogFragment)))
```

Now we will use `proxy` to create an instance of an anonymous class:

```clojure
(defn date-picker [activity]
  (proxy [DialogFragment DatePickerDialog$OnDateSetListener] []
    (onCreateDialog [savedInstanceState]
      (let [c (Calendar/getInstance)
            year (.get c Calendar/YEAR)
            month (.get c Calendar/MONTH)
            day (.get c Calendar/DAY_OF_MONTH)]
p        (DatePickerDialog. activity this year month day)))
     (onDateSet [view year month day])))
```

We will finish the `onDateSet` listener code in a bit. Calling this function creates an instance of a `date-picker` object. Let's change the definition of `main-layout` now to be a function and add a new button to the layout that will create then show this dialog.

```clojure
(declare date-picker)
(defn show-picker [^Activity activity dp]
  (. dp show (. activity getFragmentManager) "datePicker"))

(defn main-layout [activity]
  [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                :id ::name}]
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                :id ::location}]
   [:button {:text "...",
             :on-click (fn [_] (show-picker activity 
                                           (date-picker activity)))}]
   [:button {:text "+ Event"
             :on-click (fn [_] (add-event activity))}]
   [:text-view {:text @listing,
                :id ::listing}]])
```

Update your UI and try hitting that `...` button. Great, it works but doesn't do anything. We want that dialog update a `:text-view` with that chosen date. First we edit the layout:

```clojure
(defn main-layout [activity]
  [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                :id ::name}]
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                :id ::location}]
   [:linear-layout {:orientation :horizontal}
    [:text-view {:hint "Event date",
                 :id ::date}]
    [:button {:text "...",
              :on-click (fn [_] (show-picker activity
                                            (date-picker activity)))}]]
   [:button {:text "+ Event",
             :on-click (fn [_] (add-event activity))}]
   [:text-view {:text @listing,
                :id ::listing}]])
```

Note that the new `:text-view` element and the button that spawns the picker are inside a nested `:linear-layout` element. Our date string will have the YYYYMMDD format. Now let's fill out that listener function in our proxy object.

```clojure
(defn date-picker [activity]
  (proxy [DialogFragment DatePickerDialog$OnDateSetListener] []
    (onCreateDialog [savedInstanceState]
      (let [c (Calendar/getInstance)
            year (.get c Calendar/YEAR)
            month (.get c Calendar/MONTH)
            day (.get c Calendar/DAY_OF_MONTH)]
        (DatePickerDialog. activity this year month day)))
     (onDateSet [view year month day]
       (set-elmt activity ::date
		 (format "%d%02d%02d" year (inc month) day)))))
```

Now try the `date-picker` again. Let's change `add-event` to include the date. And let's clean it up a bit[*](#*).

```clojure
(defn add-event [activity]
  (swap! listing str 
  	 (apply format "%s - %s - %s\n"
                (map #(get-elmt activity %) [::date ::location ::name])))
  (update-ui activity))
```

Go ahead and try it out. Here's what our source file looks like so far:

```clojure
(ns org.stuff.events.main
  (:require [neko.activity :refer [defactivity set-content-view!]]
            [neko.debug :refer [*a]]
            [neko.ui :refer [on-ui]]
            [neko.find-view :refer [find-view]]
            [neko.threading :refer [on-ui]])
  (:import android.widget.TextView
           (java.util Calendar)
           (android.app Activity)
           (android.app DatePickerDialog DatePickerDialog$OnDateSetListener)
           (android.app DialogFragment)))

(declare add-event)
(declare date-picker)

(defn show-picker [activity dp]
  (. dp show (. activity getFragmentManager) "datePicker"))

(def listing (atom ""))

(defn main-layout [activity]
  [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                :id ::name}]
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                :id ::location}]
   [:linear-layout {:orientation :horizontal}
    [:text-view {:hint "Event date",
                 :id ::date}]
    [:button {:text "...",
              :on-click (fn [_] (show-picker activity
                                            (date-picker activity)))}]]
   [:button {:text "+ Event",
             :on-click (fn [_] (add-event activity))}]
   [:text-view {:text @listing,
                :id ::listing}]])

(defn get-elmt [activity elmt]
  (str (.getText ^TextView (find-view activity elmt))))

(defn set-elmt [activity elmt s]
  (on-ui (config (find-view activity elmt) :text s)))

(defn update-ui [activity]
  (set-elmt activity ::listing @listing)
  (set-elmt activity ::location "")
  (set-elmt activity ::name ""))

(defn add-event [activity]
  (swap! listing str 
  	 (apply format "%s - %s - %s\n"
                (map #(get-elmt activity %) [::date ::location ::name])))
  (update-ui activity))

(defn date-picker [activity]
  (proxy [DialogFragment DatePickerDialog$OnDateSetListener] []
    (onCreateDialog [savedInstanceState]
      (let [c (Calendar/getInstance)
            year (.get c Calendar/YEAR)
            month (.get c Calendar/MONTH)
            day (.get c Calendar/DAY_OF_MONTH)]
        (DatePickerDialog. activity this year month day)))
    (onDateSet [view year month day]
      (set-elmt activity ::date
                (format "%d%02d%02d" year (inc month) day)))))

(defactivity org.stuff.events.MainActivity
  :key :main

  (onCreate [this bundle]
    (.superOnCreate this bundle)
    (on-ui
      (set-content-view! (*a) (main-layout (*a))
      (set-elmt (*a) ::listing @listing)))
    ))
```

###Sorting and Formatting the Listing
Now that we have dates, we can sort our listing. Let's change our `listing` atom to hold a `sorted-map`.

```clojure
(def listing (atom (sorted-map)))
```

We will now make a major change to the `add-event` function. Are you ready? Let's leave formatting out of this and only deal with updating our data structure. The keys to our map will be an integer representing the date. Each date should be able to hold multiple events, so the value of the key will be a vector of location and name vectors[**](#**).

```clojure
(defn add-event [activity]
  (let [date-key (try
                   (read-string (get-elmt activity ::date))
                   (catch RuntimeException e "Date string is empty!"))]
    (when (number? date-key)
      (swap! listing update-in [date-key] (fnil conj [])
             [(get-elmt activity ::location) (get-elmt activity ::name)])
      (update-ui activity))))
```

Since our listing `atom` no longer references a string, we need to format our map. Since our data structure contains a vector of vectors, we will implement this using two functions to prevent this code from
looking too ugly: one to format the dates and one to format the events within each date. First, let's add a line to our `ns` form so we can use `clojure.string`'s `join` function:

```clojure
(ns org.stuff.events.main
  (:require [neko.activity :refer [defactivity set-content-view!]]
            [neko.debug :refer [*a]]
            [neko.ui :refer [on-ui]]
            [clojure.string :refer [join]]
            [neko.find-view :refer [find-view]]
            [neko.threading :refer [on-ui]])
  (:import android.widget.TextView
           (java.util Calendar)
           (android.app Activity)
           (android.app DatePickerDialog DatePickerDialog$OnDateSetListener)
           (android.app DialogFragment)))
```

Now let's write our formatting functions[*](#*). Place this code somewhere before the `main-layout` definition:

```clojure
(defn format-events [events]
  (->> (map (fn [[location event]]
              (format "%s - %s\n" location event))
            events)
       (join "                      ")))
 
(defn format-listing [lst]
  (->> (map (fn [[date events]]
               (format "%s - %s" date (format-events events)))
             lst)
       join))
```

Let's replace all occurrences in our code that assumes `@listing` to be a string with `(format-listing @listing)`. In our layout:

```clojure
(defn main-layout [activity]
  [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                :id ::name}]
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                :id ::location}]
   [:linear-layout {:orientation :horizontal}
    [:text-view {:hint "Event date",
                 :id ::date}]
    [:button {:text "...",
              :on-click (fn [_] (show-picker activity
                                            (date-picker activity)))}]]
   [:button {:text "+ Event",
             :on-click (fn [_] (add-event activity))}]
   [:text-view {:text (format-listing @listing)
                :id ::listing}]])
```

And in `update-ui`:

```clojure
(defn update-ui [activity]
  (set-elmt activity ::listing (format-listing @listing))
  (set-elmt activity ::location "")
  (set-elmt activity ::name ""))
```

And in `defactivity`:

```clojure
(defactivity org.stuff.events.MainActivity
  :key :main

  (onCreate [this bundle]
    (.superOnCreate this bundle)
    (on-ui
      (set-content-view! (*a) (main-layout (*a))
      (set-elmt (*a) ::listing (format-listing @listing))))
    ))
```

Depending on when you evaluated your new code and if/when you rotated your screen, your running app may have crashed and lost your REPL. Fear not, as this is expected to happen sooner or later. Just enter `lein droid doall` again at the command line.

###Succinctness is Power

Here is the source code so far:

```clojure
(ns org.stuff.events.main
  (:require [neko.activity :refer [defactivity set-content-view!]]
            [neko.debug :refer [*a]]
            [neko.ui :refer [on-ui]]
            [clojure.string :refer [join]]
            [neko.find-view :refer [find-view]]
            [neko.threading :refer [on-ui]])
  (:import android.widget.TextView
           (java.util Calendar)
           (android.app Activity)
           (android.app DatePickerDialog DatePickerDialog$OnDateSetListener)
           (android.app DialogFragment)))

(declare add-event)
(declare date-picker)

(defn show-picker [activity dp]
  (. dp show (. activity getFragmentManager) "datePicker"))

(def listing (atom (sorted-map)))

(defn format-events [events]
  (->> (map (fn [[location event]]
              (format "%s - %s\n" location event))
            events)
       (join "                      ")))

(defn format-listing [lst]
  (->> (map (fn [[date events]]
              (format "%s - %s" date (format-events events)))
            lst)
       join))

(defn main-layout [activity]
  [:linear-layout {:orientation :vertical}
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event name",
                :id ::name}]
   [:edit-text {:hint "Event location",
                :id ::location}]
   [:linear-layout {:orientation :horizontal}
    [:text-view {:hint "Event date",
                 :id ::date}]
    [:button {:text "...",
              :on-click (fn [_] (show-picker activity
                                            (date-picker activity)))}]]
   [:button {:text "+ Event",
             :on-click (fn [_] (add-event activity))}]
   [:text-view {:text (format-listing @listing)
                :id ::listing}]])

(defn get-elmt [activity elmt]
  (str (.getText ^TextView (find-view activity elmt))))

(defn set-elmt [activity elmt s]
  (on-ui (config (find-view activity elmt) :text s)))

(defn update-ui [activity]
  (set-elmt activity ::listing (format-listing @listing))
  (set-elmt activity ::location "")
  (set-elmt activity ::name ""))

(defn add-event [activity]
  (let [date-key (try
                   (read-string (get-elmt activity ::date))
                   (catch RuntimeException e "Date string is empty!"))]
    (when (number? date-key)
      (swap! listing update-in [date-key] (fnil conj [])
             [(get-elmt activity ::location) (get-elmt activity ::name)])
      (update-ui activity))))

(defn date-picker [activity]
  (proxy [DialogFragment DatePickerDialog$OnDateSetListener] []
    (onCreateDialog [savedInstanceState]
      (let [c (Calendar/getInstance)
            year (.get c Calendar/YEAR)
            month (.get c Calendar/MONTH)
            day (.get c Calendar/DAY_OF_MONTH)]
        (DatePickerDialog. activity this year month day)))
    (onDateSet [view year month day]
      (set-elmt activity ::date
                (format "%d%02d%02d" year (inc month) day)))))

(defactivity org.stuff.events.MainActivity
  :key :main

  (onCreate [this bundle]
    (.superOnCreate this bundle)
    (on-ui
      (set-content-view! (*a) (main-layout (*a))
      (set-elmt (*a) ::listing (format-listing @listing))))
    ))
```

This is a slightly below 100 lines of code. When I first attempted to write this app using Java, I was well over 1000 lines and didn't even have all this functionality before I gave up. If succinctness really is power[<sup>6</sup>](#6), then I'm never looking back.

###Suggestions and Tips
Hopefully this is enough to get you started developing Android apps in Clojure. I leave polishing the app as an exercise for you, dear reader. To make this app actually useful, you might want to make the sorted map data structure persistent using some sort of [content provider](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html). It might also help to make the `:text-view` for the listing scrollable once you have a lot of events listed.

#####Debugging and logging

You will probably run into errors and even bugs with the tools. [adb](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) will prove to be very valuable. In a spare terminal, run this command:

```bash
<sdk-path>/platform-tools/adb logcat
```

`neko` provides [logging](http://alexander-yakushev.github.io/neko/#neko.log) capabilities. Add this to the `:require` directive in the `ns` form:

```clojure
[neko.log :as log]
```

Now you can write lines to `adb logcat` by calling something like:

```clojure
(log/d "My log message")
```

#####I lost my REPL!
Given the instability of the current tools, runtime errors in the code, and other bugs, you will probably lose your connection to the REPL at some point during development. Follow these steps to get back into your groove. In the terminal:

```bash
lein do droid run, droid forward-port
```

And in `emacs`: `M-x cider-connect`, local machine (e.g. localhost) for 'Host', and '9999' for 'Port'. Now in the REPL, run:

```clojure
(in-ns 'org.stuff.events.main)
```
Then evaluate the `ns` form to get back into your running app's namespace. The important thing to know is that all the new code you wrote after your last `build` has to be evaluated at the REPL in order to get back to your previous state. Running `lein droid doall` at the terminal at key points of development can save you some steps whenever you lose your REPL connection.

###Conclusion
The tools available for Android development are still young. Needless to say, you will probably run into some issues and bugs along the way. If you are serious about pursuing this bleeding edge stuff, get connected with the maintainers of these tools. Alex Yakushev in particular has been very helpful and quick to respond to me personally as I was learning how to use [lein-droid](https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid/issues?state=open). Phil Hagelberg (a.k.a. [technomancy](https://github.com/technomancy)) of [lein](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) is also pretty responsive.
